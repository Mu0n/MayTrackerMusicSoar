            <h2>What Is Tracker Music?</h2>
            <p>Tracker music emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fueled by home computers like the Commodore Amiga. It's a unique way of composing music using digital samples arranged in patterns. Our focus? The iconic MOD, S3M, and IT formats that once ruled the scene.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What skill set is necessary?</strong></li>
                <p>Anyone can participate. You can make the event a learning experience on how to do tracker music. You can use it to polish your pre-existing skills. You can use it to remove the rust off what you did 28 years ago. This event is for fun.</p>
                <li><strong>Do I need special equipment?</strong></li>
                <p>While some trackers can let you use midi controllers to input the notes, it isn't necessary. Just a modern computer with a keyboard will do. It can be 100% through a modern software (including but not limited to Fast Tracker II). If it strikes your fancy, you can go back to vintage machines and use software for those.</p>
